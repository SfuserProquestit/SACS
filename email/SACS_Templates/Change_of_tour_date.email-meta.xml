Dear {!Lead.FirstName},

I refer to your booking on our Head of School Tour on 25 August.

We will be in touch closer to the date to remind you and provide further details.

We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused and look forward to welcoming you on tour on 18 August.


Yours Sincerely,
