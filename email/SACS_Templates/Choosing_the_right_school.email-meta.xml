    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}


I&apos;ve been speaking with pre-school parents recently regarding &quot;choosing the right school for your child&quot;.  As someone who went through the Kindergarten enrolment process myself last year (and also works in enrolments at a school), I can provide an objective overview on how to evaluate and select a school.


I would love to come and present to the parents of {!Account.Name} and provide an unbiased guide to school selection criteria and enrolment processes.  I can also bring along a copy of &quot;101 Questions to ask your school&quot; which provide a list of questions for parents to ask potential schools.


I can present at your centre during lunchtime or do an evening presentation. Please note: this is not a marketing activity of St Andrew&apos;s, nor does my presentation contain any advertising for the school.  It&apos;s just objective advice provided with insider knowledge!


If you would like me to present at your centre, just contact me and we will arrange a time.


Regards

Robyn
