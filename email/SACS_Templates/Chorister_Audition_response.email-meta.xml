    <textOnly>{!Lead.CreatedDate}

Dear {!Lead.FirstName},

We are delighted that your son is considering becoming a St Andrew&apos;s Cathedral Chorister. As requested, you have been booked into the Chorister Auditions on Sunday 10 August, 2014 following the 10.30am service at the Cathedral.

The morning commences at the Cathedral with a welcome by Mr Ross Cobb, Director of Music.  There will be a chance to talk to current  Choristers about their lives as Choristers, to join in singing with them, as well as individual auditions for scholarships.

We will email one week prior to auditions to remind you and provide further details.

In the meantime, if there&apos;s anything else we can help you with, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Yours Sincerely,

Robyn Pedley
Enrolment Assistant</textOnly>
