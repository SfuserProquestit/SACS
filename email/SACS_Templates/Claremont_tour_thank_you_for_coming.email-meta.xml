    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName}


Thank you for coming along on our recent school tour for Claremont College families.  I hope you found the tour insightful and have had all of your questions answered.



If you wish to apply for enrolment, the next step in the process is to complete and submit the attached Application for Enrolment form.  We will then invite you in for an enrolment interview with myself, the Registrar, approximately 12 months prior to commencing at the school.   Once we have your details on file we will keep in contact with newsletters and event invitations.



If your application is for less than 12 months prior to commencement, please contact us for an immediate enrolment interview so you can be included in the intake for that year (subject to availability).


If you have any further queries, please feel free to contact any of our Enrolments staff on 9286 9500.
