    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName}


Thank you for coming along to our Explore Year 7 information evening. We hope you found the event informative and inspiring and enjoyed the demonstrations.



The next step in the application process is for you to visit our campus for an enrolment interview with myself, the Registrar. Year 7 interviews are held two years prior to commencement, when students are in Year 5. To arrange an interview time, please contact our Enrolments team on 9286 9500.

Tell us what you think! We would love your feedback and would appreciate your time in completing this survey:

You can also keep up to date with what’s happening at St Andrew’s via our facebook page.  It’s updated daily during term time with news, photos, events and mini videos.


We’re looking forward to welcoming you again to St Andrew’s Cathedral School.

Best regards
