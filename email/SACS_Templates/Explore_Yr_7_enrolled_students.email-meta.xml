    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName}




Thank you for coming along to our recent Explore Year 7 information evening. We hope you found the evening informative and inspiring and enjoyed the demonstrations.


You will receive an invitation to our Year 7 orientation during Term 4. This is where students will meet others joining St Andrew’s, hear further about subject offerings, learn about our buddy system and discuss issues including transport and study.

Tell us what you think! We would love your feedback and would appreciate your time in completing this survey:

In the meantime, to keep up to date with what’s happening across our K-12 St Andrew’s community, visit our facebook page. It’s updated daily during term time with news, photos, events and mini videos.


If you have any further questions regarding Year 7, 2018 please let us know.  We are very excited that your family is joining our Year 7 cohort next year and I look forward to welcoming you to our community.

Regards
