    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName}


It&apos;s unfortunate that you were unable to come along on our Explore Year 7 information evening.


For our current student and those of you who have enrolled, we look forward to you joining our Year 7 cohort next year! We will be in touch to invite you to Profiling and Orientation next term.



If you are considering enrolment, our Enrolments staff are happy to assist you with your application or any queries you may have.  You can contact the Enrolments team on 9286 9500.

If you would like to visit the School, you are most welcome to come along on a Head of School tour.  We run the tours regularly throughout the school term and it&apos;s a great opportunity to tour the facilities and meet our staff and students.  You can book directly into a tour on a date that suits you via our website www.sacs.nsw.edu.au.

I look forward to the opportunity to welcome your family next time at St Andrewâ€™s Cathedral School.

Regards


Bruce Perry
Registrar/Mathematics Teacher
