    <subject>K-10 Gifted &amp; Talented and Scholarship Information Night: 9 May with Guest Speaker Dr Gabrielle Oslington</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

Dear Parents


St Andrew’s is committed to supporting all students across a range of learning abilities. Our aim is to ensure all students have equal opportunities to learn and experience success in learning. Our Gifted and Talented Education Program is a challenging program designed to target students whose academic learning needs differ significantly enough to warrant a differentiated approach to learning.


Our annual Gifted &amp; Talented and Scholarship Information Evening on Wednesday 9 May provides information and resources for parents of children who may fall into this category of learner. I extend an invitation to you, or someone you might know, to come along and find out more about how to support these unique learners.


This year’s very special Guest Speaker is Dr Gabrielle Oslington, G&amp;T Specialist, Arden speaking on the topic No One Peaks at Seven!, with an emphasis on lessons learnt from both sides of the teacher’s desk in the context of a developmental understanding of giftedness.


Following Dr Oslington’s presentation, our Head of Junior School Mrs Rhonda Robson will chair a panel discussion with specialist learning development staff on how St Andrew&apos;s approaches this area of special education.  The panel will also discuss academic and music scholarship opportunities at St Andrew&apos;s.


The discussion will cover students from Kindergarten to Year 10.


Parents and educators from all schools are welcome to attend this information evening.

“Gifted students can be very observant and curious, with intense interests, an excellent memory, a long attention span and strong reasoning skills,” explains Mrs Rhonda Robson, Head of Junior School at St Andrew’s. “They may have well-developed powers of abstraction, conceptualization and synthesis, and quickly see relationships between ideas, objects or facts. Their imaginations are often unusual or vivid.”


Mrs Robson also possesses a strong academic background in psychology and gifted education, and will be present on the night to assist parents and other educators with any questions.


“There are different ways of grouping children, such as full-time classes for gifted students, withdrawal programs where gifted students are pulled out from mixed-ability classes, specific-subject grouping or cluster grouping,” says Mrs Robson. “When gifted students are grouped together they learn faster and more effectively. They develop a better attitude to school, and there is less temptation for underachievement.”


Mrs Robson believes the seminar will be a unique chance for people to gain first-hand information about the characteristics of gifted students and ways to nurture a child’s gifts or talents. “No student should spend their time at school unmotivated, unengaged, learning little or bored,” she says. “The responsibility of an education system is to recognise this reality and then translate it into classroom practice, school organisation and adequate and equitable resourcing policies.”
