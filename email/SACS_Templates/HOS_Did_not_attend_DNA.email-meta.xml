    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName},


It&apos;s unfortunate that you were unable to visit St Andrew’s for our recent Head of School Tour.  We run the tours regularly, so if you would like the opportunity to visit again, please feel free to book via our website at https://www.sacs.nsw.edu.au/events/.


Alternatively, if you would like to book in for a private tour at a time that is more convenient to you, please feel free to contact me directly to arrange one.


In the meantime, you can keep up-to-date with what’s happening at the School via our website, Facebook page and you can view more videos on our official YouTube channel at http://www.youtube.com/user/StAndrewsOfficial


We look forward to hearing from you and thank you for considering St Andrew’s Cathedral School for your child’s education and development.


Regards
