    <textOnly>Hello {!Lead.FirstName}


We have received your booked for our upcoming Head of School Tour.  As you have indicated you are considering Junior School enrolment for next year would you like to come in for an earlier tour?


I am running a small Junior School tour on Tuesday 29 August at 9.00am - does that date suit you? If so, let me know and I will move your booking.



Regards

Robyn
