    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName}




It&apos;s unfortunately that you were unable to come along to our Junior School Information Evening.  If you would still like to come and visit the School, you are most welcome to join us for a Head of School tour.  We run the tours regularly throughout the year and you can book on to the next tour via our website at
https://www.sacs.nsw.edu.au/book-a-tour/tour-bookings/.



Attached is our Junior School information booklet that was distributed on the evening, along with the Co-curricular booklet which outlines all of the out of class activities currently available.



Save the date! You will receive invitations to the following events and we hope to see you there:


Junior School Musical: 22 - 25 August - a modern version of the much loved children&apos;s story the Pied Piper, Rats is a musical the whole family will enjoy;
School Readiness Talk (Kindergarten): Wednesday 15 August, 5.30pm - a talk covering everything you need to know to ensure your child&apos;s smooth transition to school.



In the meantime, keep updated with SACS:


You can find out what’s happening here at our St Andrew’s community by visiting our website, facebook page and our official youtube channel. They’re updated daily during term time with news, photos, events and mini videos.



I look forward to welcoming you and your family to St Andrew&apos;s Cathedral School.



Regards



Bruce Perry
