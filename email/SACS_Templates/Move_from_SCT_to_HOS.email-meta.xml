    <subject>St Andrew&apos;s Cathedral School - school tour</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Lead.FirstName}


We have received your booked for our upcoming Senior College Tour.  The Senior College Tour is aimed at prospective students considering Year 10 or Year 11 entry into St Andrew&apos;s Cathedral School.


As you have indicated that you are considering Year 7 for your child, may I suggest perhaps coming along on our Head of School Tour on [date]?  It&apos;s more of a whole-of-school tour which provides a great insight into Middle School (Yrs 7 - 9) right through to Senior College (Years 10 - 12).


If you are able to come along on our Head of School Tour, please let me know and I will book you a place.  If that date doesn&apos;t suit, I can advise of future tour dates that might be more convenient.


Regards

Robyn
