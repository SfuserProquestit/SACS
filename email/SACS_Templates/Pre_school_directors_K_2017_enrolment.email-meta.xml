    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}




Due to many families relocating to Sydney, we are receiving enquiries regarding pre-school vacancies.  I have also received many enquiries from new students seeking pre school placement for their younger siblings.


Accordingly, do you currently have any vacancies in your centre?  Either for this year or 2015.  If so, for which age groups?  Do you have to work for a certain company to get a place?  Please let me know as it would be useful to know where I can refer families.



{!Contact.FirstName}, thank you for your help with this and I look forward to being in touch regarding our School Readiness Talk on August 6.



Thanks and regards,

Robyn
