    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.OwnerFirstName}


It&apos;s unfortunate that you weren&apos;t able to attend our recent School Readiness Talk.  There are some useful information and links from the presentation in the attached &apos;School Readiness&apos; document.


The next event on our Kinder calendar is our Kindergarten Open Morning that we are having on September 11.  It&apos;s wonderful opportunity for pre school parents and children to come along and see our Kindergarten class in action, meet our Infants teaching staff and tour our Junior School facilities. I will be sending out invitations for that event soon.


I look forward to future opportunities for us to continue to work together for great outcomes for our school starters.



Regards



Bruce Perry
Registrar/Mathematics Teacher
