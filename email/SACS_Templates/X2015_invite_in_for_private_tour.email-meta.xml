    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName}


Thank you for your recent tour booking.


As you are enquiring into {!Lead.Year_Group__c}, 2015, we would like to invite you in for an enrolment interview and private tour.  Coming in before the school tour will give you the time to consider enrolment for next year and attend any new student examinations or orientations this term.


If you would like to arrange an appointment, please contact me ASAP.


We look forward to welcoming you and your family to St Andrew&apos;s Cathedral School.




Kindest regards
