    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName}


I am delighted to announce that, due to popular demand, we are expanding our Year 4 cohort by another class in 2019!


Many families choose to start at St Andrew’s in Year 4, enabling an earlier transition to our Junior School, making friends and accessing the world of opportunities on offer.


I warmly invite you and your child to join us for a special Year 4 Open Morning on Tuesday 30 October at 9.00am. During your visit you will participate in classroom activities, tour our specialist music and science facilities and meet our wonderful staff and students.
