    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName}



Thank you for your enquiry regarding potential Year 7, 2019 enrolment.


Enrolment interviews for the year group have been conducted and I&apos;m pleased to advise that we are still accepting applications for the year group, however applications need to be submitted as soon as possible. Interviews will be arranged as soon as applications are received.  All interviews include a private tour of the school.



If you have not yet had the chance to visit the school, I would like to invite you along to a special Head of School Tour for Year 7, 2019 families on Tuesday 10 April at 9.00am. This tour provides the opportunity to see the school in action, meet our staff and speak with student representatives.



Bookings essential. You can book in directly to the tour via our website at
